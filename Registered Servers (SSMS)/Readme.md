If you want to register your database servers and you don't have much time to organize or you have a lot of decommissioned servers you can use this script.

Location 
C:\Users\your username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\120\Tools\Shell\RegSrvr.xml

Tips:
- This folder "C:\Users\your username\AppData" is by default hidden.
- If you have an old version of SSMS like 2014 and then you install a new one 18, it will use the same location.
