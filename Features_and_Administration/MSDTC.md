### To evaluate my understanding of MSDTC in SQL Server, consider this example: I have two databases, either on the same instance, different instances, or different servers. Each database has its own transaction log file. An application submits a transaction to insert 5 rows into T1 in DB1, then inserts 50 rows into T2 in DB2. It subsequently updates another 3 rows in T1 in DB1 and deletes 100 rows in T2 in DB2. If a failure occurs and the transaction was initiated with implicit transactions on, it must roll back all these actions. The transaction manager for each database, whether on the same instance, different instances, or different servers, must initiate an abort on each transaction log, undoing the transactions (insert = delete, update = revert, delete = insert). MSDTC's role is to coordinate between servers to ensure either all transactions are rolled back or all are committed. In an availability group with DTC_Support set to Per_DB, each database has its own resource manager to ensure the transaction is correctly managed. 

Your understanding of Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) in SQL Server is quite comprehensive. Let me summarize and clarify a few key points to ensure everything is clear:

1. **Transaction Scope**: When an application submits a transaction that involves multiple operations across different databases (whether on the same instance, different instances, or different servers), each database maintains its own transaction log file.

2. **Transaction Operations**: In your example, the transaction includes:
   - Inserting 5 rows into Table T1 in Database DB1.
   - Inserting 50 rows into Table T2 in Database DB2.
   - Updating 3 rows in Table T1 in Database DB1.
   - Deleting 100 rows from Table T2 in Database DB2.

3. **Implicit Transactions**: If the transaction is initiated with `implicit_transaction` on, it means that the transaction will automatically start without an explicit `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement.

4. **Failure and Rollback**: If a failure occurs, the transaction must be rolled back. The transaction manager for each database will undo the operations:
   - Insert operations will be undone by deleting the inserted rows.
   - Update operations will be reversed by updating the rows back to their original values.
   - Delete operations will be undone by re-inserting the deleted rows.

5. **Role of MSDTC**: MSDTC coordinates the distributed transaction across multiple databases and servers. It ensures that all parts of the transaction are either committed or rolled back together, maintaining data consistency.

6. **Availability Groups and DTC Support**: In the case of databases in an availability group with `DTC_Support = Per_DB`, each database has its own resource manager. This configuration ensures that the transaction is correctly managed and coordinated by MSDTC, even in a high-availability environment.

Your explanation captures the essential role of MSDTC in coordinating distributed transactions and ensuring data consistency across multiple databases and servers.
