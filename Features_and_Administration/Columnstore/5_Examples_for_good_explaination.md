## Let's say I have a table with 50 columns and a clustered index column store containing 5000 rowgroups. If a select statement requires only 100 rowgroups and 10 columns, the engine will select these 100 rowgroups, extract the 10 segments for each rowgroup, decompress these segments, and convert them from columnar to regular rowstore. It will then perform the necessary relations and aggregations before presenting the results to the user. 

that's quite accurate! Here's a detailed breakdown to confirm and clarify:

1. **Selecting Rowgroups**: When your query needs only 100 rowgroups out of 5000, the SQL Server engine will indeed scan only those 100 rowgroups. This selective scanning is one of the key benefits of columnstore indexes.

2. **Column Segments**: Since your query requires only 10 out of 50 columns, the engine will read only the segments corresponding to those 10 columns within each of the 100 rowgroups. This minimizes the amount of data that needs to be read and processed.

3. **Decompression**: The selected column segments will be decompressed as needed. Columnstore indexes store data in a highly compressed format to save space and improve performance, but this data must be decompressed for processing.

4. **Conversion to Rowstore**: After decompression, the data is indeed converted from its columnar format to a rowstore format. This conversion allows the engine to perform operations like joins, aggregations, and other relational operations efficiently.

5. **Query Execution**: The engine will then execute the necessary operations (e.g., joins, aggregations) on the rowstore format data and present the results to the user.

Your understanding captures the essence of how SQL Server optimizes query performance using columnstore indexes and rowgroups. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data processed, leading to faster query execution times.

#### I have a table with 100 rows with a clustered columnstore index. Is there a rowgroup here?

In SQL Server, a rowgroup is created when you have a columnstore index, but the size of the rowgroup depends on the number of rows. Each rowgroup can contain up to 1,048,576 rows. 

For a table with only 100 rows and a clustered columnstore index, all rows would typically be placed into a single rowgroup. This rowgroup would be in an **OPEN** state initially, as it hasn't reached the maximum size to be compressed into the columnstore format. 

So, yes, there would be a rowgroup, but it would be relatively small and not yet fully optimized for the benefits of columnstore compression and performance.

#### When will I have a deltastore?

In SQL Server, a **deltastore** is used to handle data modifications (inserts, updates, and deletes) for columnstore indexes. Here's when and how a deltastore comes into play:

1. **Small Batches of Inserts**: When you insert a small number of rows (typically less than 102,400 rows) into a table with a columnstore index, these rows are initially stored in the deltastore. This is because it's more efficient to handle small inserts in a rowstore format before converting them to the columnstore format.

2. **Updates and Deletes**: When rows are updated or deleted, the deltastore and a delete bitmap are used to manage these changes. The delete bitmap keeps track of deleted rows, while the deltastore temporarily holds the updated rows.

3. **Tuple Mover Process**: Periodically, a background process called the tuple mover compresses the data in the deltastore and moves it into the columnstore. This process ensures that the data is eventually stored in the highly compressed columnar format.

### Example Scenario
If you have a table with 100 rows and you insert an additional 50 rows, these new rows will be placed in the deltastore. Once the number of rows in the deltastore reaches a threshold (typically around 102,400 rows), the tuple mover will compress these rows and move them into the columnstore.

**debate 2**
#### Currently, the table has only 100 rows and is not in a columnar format. However, when the delta reaches around 102,400 rows, the tuple mover will add them into a rowgroup. It will then create a segment for each column and compress the data.

You're correct that with only 100 rows, the table is not yet in a fully columnar format. Here's how the process works in more detail:

1. **Initial State**: With only 100 rows, these rows are stored in the deltastore, which is a rowstore format. This is because the number of rows is too small to justify the overhead of creating a columnstore rowgroup.

2. **Accumulating Rows**: As more rows are inserted into the table, they continue to be added to the deltastore. The deltastore can handle these small batches efficiently.

3. **Threshold Reached**: Once the number of rows in the deltastore reaches the threshold (typically around 102,400 rows), the tuple mover process is triggered.

4. **Tuple Mover Process**: The tuple mover compresses the rows in the deltastore and converts them into a columnstore format. This involves:
   - **Creating Rowgroups**: The rows are grouped into rowgroups, each containing up to 1,048,576 rows.
   - **Creating Segments**: For each column in the rowgroup, a segment is created. These segments store the data in a columnar format.
   - **Compression**: The segments are then compressed to optimize storage and query performance.

5. **Columnstore Format**: After the tuple mover process, the data is now stored in a columnstore format, with rowgroups and compressed column segments.

In your case, with only 100 rows, the table remains in the deltastore until enough rows are accumulated to trigger the tuple mover. This ensures that the overhead of creating and managing columnstore rowgroups is only incurred when there is a sufficient amount of data to benefit from the columnstore format.
