but in this case the table has only 100 rows so, till this moment the table practiclly is not in a columnar format, so how when the delta reachs around 102,400 rows the tuple mover will add them into rowgroup then make for each column a segment and then compress it

You're correct that with only 100 rows, the table is not yet in a fully columnar format. Here's how the process works in more detail:

1. **Initial State**: With only 100 rows, these rows are stored in the deltastore, which is a rowstore format. This is because the number of rows is too small to justify the overhead of creating a columnstore rowgroup.

2. **Accumulating Rows**: As more rows are inserted into the table, they continue to be added to the deltastore. The deltastore can handle these small batches efficiently.

3. **Threshold Reached**: Once the number of rows in the deltastore reaches the threshold (typically around 102,400 rows), the tuple mover process is triggered.

4. **Tuple Mover Process**: The tuple mover compresses the rows in the deltastore and converts them into a columnstore format. This involves:
   - **Creating Rowgroups**: The rows are grouped into rowgroups, each containing up to 1,048,576 rows.
   - **Creating Segments**: For each column in the rowgroup, a segment is created. These segments store the data in a columnar format.
   - **Compression**: The segments are then compressed to optimize storage and query performance.

5. **Columnstore Format**: After the tuple mover process, the data is now stored in a columnstore format, with rowgroups and compressed column segments.

In your case, with only 100 rows, the table remains in the deltastore until enough rows are accumulated to trigger the tuple mover. This ensures that the overhead of creating and managing columnstore rowgroups is only incurred when there is a sufficient amount of data to benefit from the columnstore format.
