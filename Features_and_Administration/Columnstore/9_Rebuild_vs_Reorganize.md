Deciding when to rebuild or reorganize a columnstore index depends on the level of fragmentation and the specific needs of your workload. Here are some guidelines to help you determine the best approach:

### When to Reorganize
- **Low to Moderate Fragmentation**: If the percentage of deleted rows is relatively low (typically less than 20%), reorganizing the index can be sufficient. This operation is less resource-intensive and can be performed online, meaning it doesn't block queries.
- **Frequent Maintenance**: Reorganizing is suitable for regular maintenance to keep the index in good shape without significant downtime.

### When to Rebuild
- **High Fragmentation**: If the percentage of deleted rows is high (typically above 20%), rebuilding the index is recommended. This operation completely recreates the index, eliminating all fragmentation.
- **Significant Performance Degradation**: If you notice a substantial drop in query performance due to fragmentation, rebuilding the index can restore optimal performance.
- **Resource Availability**: Rebuilding is more resource-intensive and may require downtime, so it's best scheduled during maintenance windows when the system load is low.

### Example Scenario
- **Reorganize**: You have a columnstore index with 15% deleted rows. You can use the `ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE` command to defragment the index without significant impact on your system.
  ```sql
  ALTER INDEX IndexName ON SchemaName.TableName REORGANIZE;
  ```

- **Rebuild**: You have a columnstore index with 30% deleted rows, and queries are running slower. You decide to rebuild the index to eliminate fragmentation and improve performance.
  ```sql
  ALTER INDEX IndexName ON SchemaName.TableName REBUILD;
  ```

### Monitoring Fragmentation
Regularly monitor the fragmentation levels using the `sys.dm_db_column_store_row_group_physical_stats` DMV to decide when to perform these maintenance tasks.
