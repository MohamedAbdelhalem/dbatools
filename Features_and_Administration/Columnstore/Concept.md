Let's say I have a table with 50 columns and a clustered index column store containing 5000 rowgroups. 
If a select statement requires only 100 rowgroups and 10 columns, the engine will select these 100 rowgroups, 
extract the 10 segments for each rowgroup, decompress these segments, and convert them from columnar to regular rowstore. 
It will then perform the necessary relations and aggregations before presenting the results to the user. 

Could you please evaluate my understanding?


that's quite accurate! Here's a detailed breakdown to confirm and clarify:

1. **Selecting Rowgroups**: When your query needs only 100 rowgroups out of 5000, the SQL Server engine will indeed scan only those 100 rowgroups. This selective scanning is one of the key benefits of columnstore indexes.

2. **Column Segments**: Since your query requires only 10 out of 50 columns, the engine will read only the segments corresponding to those 10 columns within each of the 100 rowgroups. This minimizes the amount of data that needs to be read and processed.

3. **Decompression**: The selected column segments will be decompressed as needed. Columnstore indexes store data in a highly compressed format to save space and improve performance, but this data must be decompressed for processing.

4. **Conversion to Rowstore**: After decompression, the data is indeed converted from its columnar format to a rowstore format. This conversion allows the engine to perform operations like joins, aggregations, and other relational operations efficiently.

5. **Query Execution**: The engine will then execute the necessary operations (e.g., joins, aggregations) on the rowstore format data and present the results to the user.

Your understanding captures the essence of how SQL Server optimizes query performance using columnstore indexes and rowgroups. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data processed, leading to faster query execution times.

Is there anything else you'd like to explore about columnstore indexes or SQL Server in general?
