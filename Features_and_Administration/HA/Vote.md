In Windows Failover Cluster Manager, the "Nodes" tab displays information about the nodes in your cluster. The columns "Assigned Vote" and "Current Vote" have specific meanings and indicate different aspects of the cluster's quorum configuration.

1. **Assigned Vote**: This column shows the number of votes that have been assigned to each node. By default, each node in the cluster is assigned one vote. This assignment can be modified based on the cluster's quorum configuration and requirements. The assigned vote is a static value that does not change unless manually adjusted.

2. **Current Vote**: This column indicates the number of votes that each node currently has in the cluster's quorum. The current vote can change dynamically based on the cluster's configuration and the state of the nodes. For example, if a node is down or not participating in the cluster, its current vote may be set to zero. This dynamic adjustment helps the cluster maintain quorum and continue operating even if some nodes are unavailable.

The difference between these two columns lies in their purpose and behavior. The assigned vote is a static configuration, while the current vote reflects the real-time status and participation of each node in the cluster's quorum. This dynamic adjustment is part of the cluster's quorum management, which ensures that the cluster can continue to function correctly even in the event of node failures.
