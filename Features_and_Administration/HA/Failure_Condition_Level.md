In SQL Server Availability Groups from version 2016 onward, the `FailureConditionLevel` property determines the conditions under which an automatic failover will occur. This property can be set to different levels, each specifying a set of failure conditions. Here’s a breakdown of the levels relevant to your question about log file accessibility:

### FailureConditionLevel Settings

1. **Level 1**: Critical server errors, such as SQL Server service termination.
2. **Level 2**: Level 1 conditions plus additional critical errors like non-yielding scheduler or severe memory pressure.
3. **Level 3**: Level 2 conditions plus moderate errors, including database-level issues like database corruption.
4. **Level 4**: Level 3 conditions plus less severe errors, such as availability replica issues.
5. **Level 5**: Level 4 conditions plus any other errors that might affect the availability group, including issues with the transaction log file.

### Log File Accessibility

If the transaction log file becomes inaccessible, it would typically trigger a failover at **FailureConditionLevel 5**. This level includes all possible errors that could impact the availability group, ensuring that even issues with the transaction log file are covered.

### Configuration

To configure the `FailureConditionLevel`, you can use Transact-SQL or PowerShell. Here’s an example using Transact-SQL to set the failure condition level to 5:

```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [YourAvailabilityGroupName]
SET (FAILURE_CONDITION_LEVEL = 5);
```

### Use Cases

- **High Availability**: Ensuring that even minor issues, like log file accessibility problems, trigger a failover to maintain high availability.
- **Data Integrity**: Protecting against data loss by failing over when critical components, such as the transaction log, are compromised.
