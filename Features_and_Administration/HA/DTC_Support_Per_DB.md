## Can you compare between failover with `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` and without DTC in sql server availability group.

Here's a comparison between failover with `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` and using MSDTC in a SQL Server Availability Group:

### Failover with `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`

1. **Resource Management**: Each database in the availability group acts as its own resource manager for distributed transactions¹. This means that each database independently manages its transactions, which can help in isolating issues and improving fault tolerance.

2. **Failover Handling**: During a failover, each database can independently manage in-doubt transactions. This can lead to more granular control and potentially faster recovery times.

3. **Configuration Complexity**: Setting up `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` can be more complex as it requires configuring each database as a resource manager.

4. **Performance**: There might be some performance overhead due to the additional coordination required for distributed transactions across multiple databases.

### Failover with MSDTC (without `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`)

1. **Centralized Resource Management**: The SQL Server instance acts as the resource manager for distributed transactions. This centralizes transaction management, which can simplify configuration and monitoring.

2. **Failover Handling**: During a failover, the new primary replica needs to get the transaction outcome from MSDTC. If the availability group is not configured for distributed transactions, this can lead to issues with in-doubt transactions.

3. **Configuration Simplicity**: Using MSDTC without `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` can be simpler to set up, as it relies on the SQL Server instance to manage transactions.

4. **Performance**: There might be less performance overhead compared to `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`, as the transaction management is centralized.

### Key Differences

- **Granularity**: `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` provides more granular control over transactions at the database level, while using MSDTC centralizes transaction management at the instance level.
- **Failover Recovery**: `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` can potentially offer faster and more reliable failover recovery by managing transactions at the database level.
- **Complexity**: `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` is more complex to configure and manage, but it offers better isolation and fault tolerance.

### Use Cases

- **Use `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`**: When you need fine-grained control over distributed transactions and better failover handling at the database level.
- **Use MSDTC without `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`**: When you prefer simpler configuration and centralized transaction management, and your distributed transaction requirements are less complex.


## If I have 150 databases in the same instance with only one availability group and the application never uses queries that join tables from different databases or involves transactions across multiple databases, do I need to configure DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB? 

In your scenario, where you have 150 databases in a single instance within one availability group and your application does not perform cross-database transactions or joins, you **do not need to configure `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`**. 

### Reasons:
1. **No Cross-Database Transactions**: Since your application does not involve transactions that span multiple databases, the primary benefit of `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`—managing distributed transactions—is not applicable.
2. **Simpler Configuration**: Without the need for distributed transaction support, you can avoid the additional complexity and overhead associated with configuring and managing `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`.
3. **Performance**: By not enabling `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB`, you can potentially reduce the performance overhead that comes with managing distributed transactions.

### Conclusion:
For your use case, relying on the regular transaction manager without configuring `DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB` is sufficient and more efficient.
