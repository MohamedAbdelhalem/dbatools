The **Ledger** feature in SQL Server, introduced in SQL Server 2022, provides tamper-evidence capabilities for your database. It leverages blockchain-inspired technology to ensure data integrity by creating an immutable record of all changes made to the data. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

### Key Features of SQL Server Ledger
1. **Tamper-Evident Data**: Ledger uses cryptographic hashes to create a secure, tamper-evident chain of data changes. This ensures that any unauthorized modifications can be detected.
2. **Historical Data Preservation**: It maintains historical versions of data, allowing you to track changes over time without losing previous values.
3. **Two Types of Ledger Tables**:
   - **Updatable Ledger Tables**: Suitable for transactional data that updates over time.
   - **Append-Only Ledger Tables**: Ideal for auditing and regulatory compliance, where only additions are allowed.

### Target Audience
The Ledger feature is particularly beneficial for industries where data integrity and auditability are critical, such as:
- **Finance**: Ensuring the integrity of financial transactions and records.
- **Healthcare**: Protecting sensitive patient data and maintaining accurate medical records.
- **Retail and E-commerce**: Securing transaction data and customer information.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Providing a trustworthy record of transactions across multiple parties.

### Example Use Case
To create a ledger table, you can use the following SQL command:
```sql
CREATE TABLE SalesLedger (
    SalesID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SalesAmount MONEY,
    LedgerPeriod INT
) WITH (LEDGER = ON);
```
This command enables the ledger feature for the `SalesLedger` table, ensuring all changes are securely logged and verifiable.
