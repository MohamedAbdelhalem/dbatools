The **Ledger** feature in SQL Server, introduced in SQL Server 2022, provides tamper-evidence capabilities for your database. It leverages blockchain-inspired technology to ensure data integrity by creating an immutable record of all changes made to the data. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

### Key Features of SQL Server Ledger
1. **Tamper-Evident Data**: Ledger uses cryptographic hashes to create a secure, tamper-evident chain of data changes. This ensures that any unauthorized modifications can be detected.
2. **Historical Data Preservation**: It maintains historical versions of data, allowing you to track changes over time without losing previous values.
3. **Two Types of Ledger Tables**:
   - **Updatable Ledger Tables**: Suitable for transactional data that updates over time.
   - **Append-Only Ledger Tables**: Ideal for auditing and regulatory compliance, where only additions are allowed.

### Target Audience
The Ledger feature is particularly beneficial for industries where data integrity and auditability are critical, such as:
- **Finance**: Ensuring the integrity of financial transactions and records.
- **Healthcare**: Protecting sensitive patient data and maintaining accurate medical records.
- **Retail and E-commerce**: Securing transaction data and customer information.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Providing a trustworthy record of transactions across multiple parties.

### Example Use Case
To create a ledger table, you can use the following SQL command:
```sql
-- Create a new schema and table called [Account].[Balance].
-- Creating updatable ledger tables requires the ENABLE LEDGER permission.

CREATE SCHEMA [Account];
GO  
CREATE TABLE [Account].[Balance]
([CustomerID] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
    [LastName] VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    [FirstName] VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    [Balance] DECIMAL (10,2) NOT NULL)
WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = [Account].[BalanceHistory]),
 LEDGER = ON);

--When your updatable ledger table is created, the corresponding history table and ledger view are also created. Run the following T-SQL commands to see the new table and the new view.

SELECT ts.[name] + '.' + t.[name] AS [ledger_table_name]
, hs.[name] + '.' + h.[name] AS [history_table_name]
, vs.[name] + '.' + v.[name] AS [ledger_view_name]
FROM sys.tables AS t
JOIN sys.tables AS h ON (h.[object_id] = t.[history_table_id])
JOIN sys.views v ON (v.[object_id] = t.[ledger_view_id])
JOIN sys.schemas ts ON (ts.[schema_id] = t.[schema_id])
JOIN sys.schemas hs ON (hs.[schema_id] = h.[schema_id])
JOIN sys.schemas vs ON (vs.[schema_id] = v.[schema_id])
WHERE t.[name] = 'Balance';

-- Insert the name Nick Jones as a new customer with an opening balance of $50.

INSERT INTO [Account].[Balance]
VALUES (1, 'Jones', 'Nick', 50);

-- Insert the names John Smith, Joe Smith, and Mary Michaels as new customers with opening balances of $500, $30, and $200, respectively.

INSERT INTO [Account].[Balance]
VALUES(2, 'Smith', 'John', 500),
(3, 'Smith', 'Joe', 30),
(4, 'Michaels', 'Mary', 200);

--View the [Account].[Balance] updatable ledger table, and specify the GENERATED ALWAY columns added to the table.

SELECT [CustomerID]
   ,[LastName]
   ,[FirstName]
   ,[Balance]
   ,[ledger_start_transaction_id]
   ,[ledger_end_transaction_id]
   ,[ledger_start_sequence_number]
   ,[ledger_end_sequence_number]
 FROM [Account].[Balance];

/* In the results window, you'll first see the values inserted by your T-SQL commands, along with the system metadata that's used for data lineage purposes.

The ledger_start_transaction_id column notes the unique transaction ID associated with the transaction that inserted the data. Because John, Joe, and Mary were inserted by using the same transaction, they share the same transaction ID.

The ledger_start_sequence_number column notes the order by which values were inserted by the transaction.
*/

-- Update Nick's balance from 50 to 100.

UPDATE [Account].[Balance] SET [Balance] = 100
WHERE [CustomerID] = 1;

-- View the [Account].[Balance] ledger view, along with the transaction ledger system view to identify users that made the changes.

SELECT t.[commit_time] AS [CommitTime] 
 , t.[principal_name] AS [UserName]
 , l.[CustomerID]
 , l.[LastName]
 , l.[FirstName]
 , l.[Balance]
 , l.[ledger_operation_type_desc] AS Operation
 FROM [Account].[Balance_Ledger] l
 JOIN sys.database_ledger_transactions t
 ON t.transaction_id = l.ledger_transaction_id
 ORDER BY t.commit_time DESC;

 /* Nick's account balance was successfully updated in the updatable ledger table to 100. The ledger view shows that updating the ledger table is a DELETE of the original row with 50. The balance with a corresponding INSERT of a new row with 100 shows the new balance for Nick. */

 SELECT * FROM Account.BalanceHistory

```
