The "Log on as a service" security policy in SQL Server allows a service account to log on to the system as a service. This is essential for SQL Server services to start and run properly. When this policy is assigned to a service account, it grants the account the necessary permissions to log on and operate as a service.

If the "Log on as a service" role is missing for a service account, the SQL Server services that rely on this account will fail to start. This can lead to various issues, such as the inability to access the SQL Server database, execute jobs, or perform automated tasks Essentially, the services will be unable to authenticate and run, causing disruptions in database operations.

If you encounter this issue, you can manually add the service account to the "Log on as a service" policy using the Local Security Policy tool (secpol.msc) on Windows.
