Is it a good idea to create a new hash index and then drop the old one with high collision, instead of dropping and recreating the hash index?

Creating a new hash index and then dropping the old one can be a good strategy to minimize downtime and maintain table access. Here’s how this approach can help:

1. **Minimize Impact**: By creating a new hash index first, you ensure that the table remains indexed and accessible during the process. This can help maintain query performance and reduce the impact on users.

2. **Seamless Transition**: Once the new index is created, you can drop the old index. This approach allows for a smoother transition and ensures that there is always an index available for query optimization.

3. **Resource Considerations**: Keep in mind that creating a new index will still consume resources and might temporarily impact performance. However, this impact is generally less disruptive than having no index at all during the recreation process.

4. **Steps to Follow**:
   - **Create the New Index**: Create the new hash index with the desired `BUCKET_COUNT`.
   - **Verify the New Index**: Ensure that the new index is functioning correctly and that performance is as expected.
   - **Drop the Old Index**: Once you are confident that the new index is working well, drop the old index.

Here’s an example of how you might do this:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the new hash index
CREATE HASH INDEX new_hash_index ON customers (customer_id) WITH (BUCKET_COUNT = 20000000);

-- Step 2: Verify the new index (run some queries to ensure performance is good)

-- Step 3: Drop the old hash index
DROP INDEX old_hash_index ON customers;
```

This approach helps ensure that your table remains performant and accessible throughout the process.
