**Microsoft recommends restoring from a good backup first because when you restore the full backup (assuming the full backup is clean or free of corruption) and then apply all transaction logs up to the tail log backup, you ensure that all transactions are redone. This process guarantees clean pages and helps mitigate any corruption.
Maintaining a large retention of backup files can help mitigate corruption issues. Additionally, performing a weekly DBCC CHECKDB can ensure that the restoration process is brief and that you have a clean, full backup.

how to fix the page header when was overwritten with zeros as it due to bad disk cache, so how to use undocumented commands to fix this issue?
**Response**
Fixing a page header that has been overwritten with zeros due to a bad disk cache is a complex and risky process. It involves using undocumented commands, which should be used with extreme caution and only in non-production environments. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to approach this:

### Understanding the Issue
When a page header is overwritten with zeros, it means that the metadata for that page is lost, making it difficult for SQL Server to interpret the data on that page. This can happen due to hardware issues like a bad disk cache.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Identify the Corrupted Page**: First, you need to identify the corrupted page. You can use the `DBCC PAGE` command to dump the contents of the page and verify the corruption.

    ```sql
    DBCC TRACEON (3604);
    DBCC PAGE ('YourDatabaseName', 1, 224, 3); -- Example page ID
    ```

2. **Calculate the Page Offset**: Determine the offset within the page where the corruption occurred. This involves calculating the exact byte position of the corrupted data.

3. **Use DBCC WRITEPAGE**: Use the `DBCC WRITEPAGE` command to overwrite the corrupted data. This command is undocumented and can cause irreparable damage if used incorrectly. Here’s an example:

    ```sql
    -- WARNING: This command can cause irreparable damage. Do not run in a production environment.
    USE master;
    GO
    ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    GO
    DBCC WRITEPAGE ('YourDatabaseName', 1, 224, 1155, 1, 0x0, 1); -- Example values
    GO
    ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] SET MULTI_USER;
    GO
    ```

    In this example, `1155` is the offset, `1` is the number of bytes to write, and `0x0` is the value to write.

### Important Considerations
- **Backup**: Always take a full backup of your database before attempting any repairs.
- **Non-Production Environment**: Perform these steps in a non-production environment to avoid data loss.
- **Consult Experts**: If you are not comfortable performing these steps, consult with a SQL Server expert or Microsoft Support.

### Example Scenario
Imagine you have a page with ID 224 that has been corrupted. You would first dump the page contents using `DBCC PAGE` to confirm the corruption. Then, calculate the offset where the corruption occurred and use `DBCC WRITEPAGE` to overwrite the corrupted data. Finally, set the database back to multi-user mode.
