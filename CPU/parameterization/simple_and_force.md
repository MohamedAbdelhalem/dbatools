Forced parameterization in SQL Server has its pros and cons. Here's a summary:

### Pros:
1. **Improved Plan Reuse**: By parameterizing queries, SQL Server can reuse execution plans for similar queries with different parameter values, reducing the overhead associated with query compilation.
2. **Reduced Plan Cache Bloat**: It helps in reducing the number of execution plans stored in the plan cache, which can improve overall performance.
3. **Consistent Performance**: It can lead to more predictable performance by avoiding the need to compile new plans for each variation of a query.

### Cons:
1. **Suboptimal Plans**: Forced parameterization can sometimes lead to the reuse of suboptimal query plans, especially in cases where data distribution is skewed.
2. **Impact on Filtered Indexes**: It can render filtered indexes less effective, as the same plan might be reused even when a different plan would be more efficient.
3. **Potential for Performance Degradation**: In some scenarios, forced parameterization can cause performance degradation due to the reuse of inappropriate plans.
