Using a `uniqueidentifier` column with `NEWID()` as the first column in a clustered index can be beneficial for systems with high insert operations, but it may not be ideal for systems with high select operations. Here's why:

### High Insert Operations
- **Reduced Contention**: The random nature of `NEWID()` helps distribute inserts across different pages, reducing page latch contention and improving concurrency.
- **Better Scalability**: This approach scales well in high-concurrency environments, making it suitable for systems with frequent insert operations.

### High Select Operations
- **Increased Fragmentation**: The random inserts can lead to higher index fragmentation, which can negatively impact read performance.
- **Larger Index Size**: The `uniqueidentifier` data type is larger than typical integer-based keys, leading to increased index size and potentially slower read operations.

### Summary
- **Good for High Inserts**: The solution is effective for systems with high insert operations due to reduced contention and better scalability.
- **Not Ideal for High Selects**: The increased fragmentation and larger index size can negatively impact read performance, making it less suitable for systems with high select operations.
