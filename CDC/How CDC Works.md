Change Data Capture (CDC) in SQL Server is a feature that tracks and records changes made to the data in your database tables? 
It's particularly useful for scenarios where you need to capture and analyze data modifications over time. Here's a brief overview of how CDC works and its key use cases:

### How CDC Works:
1. **Enable CDC**: First, you need to enable CDC at the database level using the stored procedure `sys.sp_cdc_enable_db`.
2. **Enable Tables**: Next, you enable CDC for specific tables using `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table`. This creates associated change tables that store the changes made to the tracked tables?
3. **Capture Process**: SQL Server captures changes (inserts, updates, deletes) from the transaction log and stores them in the change tables?
4. **Query Changes**: You can use system functions provided by CDC to query the change data? These functions return a result set with the changes made to the tracked tables?

### Key Use Cases:
1. **Incremental Data Loading**: CDC is ideal for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes where only the changed data needs to be transferred to a data warehouse or data mart?
2. **Real-time Analytics**: CDC enables real-time data integration into analytical systems, providing up-to-date insights for decision-making.
3. **Data Synchronization**: It can be used for on-premises data synchronization to the cloud, ensuring that changes are consistently propagated.
4. **Cache Invalidation**: CDC can help in invalidating caches by capturing and propagating data changes.
