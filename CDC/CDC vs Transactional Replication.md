### Change Data Capture (CDC)
- **Purpose**: Primarily used for auditing and tracking changes made to the data over time.
- **Operation**: CDC captures changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to the database tables and stores them in change tables. These changes can then be queried and analyzed.
- **Data Storage**: The original data remains in the source database, and only the changes are stored in the change tables.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for scenarios where you need to analyze historical data changes, perform incremental data loads, or synchronize data to other systems.

### Transactional Replication
- **Purpose**: Used to replicate data from one database to another, maintaining a copy of the data in the destination database.
- **Operation**: Transactional replication involves a publisher (source database), a distributor (middleman), and a subscriber (destination database). The Log Reader Agent reads the transaction log of the publisher and copies the transactions to the distributor, which then sends them to the subscriber.
- **Data Storage**: The data is replicated to the subscriber database, creating an exact copy of the source data.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for scenarios where you need real-time data replication, disaster recovery, or distributing data to multiple locations.

### Key Differences
- **Data Storage**: CDC stores only the changes, while transactional replication stores a complete copy of the data.
- **Use Cases**: CDC is more focused on auditing and incremental data loads, whereas transactional replication is geared towards real-time data replication and disaster recovery.
- **Complexity**: Transactional replication typically involves more setup and maintenance compared to CDC.
