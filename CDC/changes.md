Microsoft SQL Server does provide built-in functions to help you convert changes captured by CDC into insert, update, or delete statements. You don't necessarily need to write custom code for this conversion process. 

Here are some key functions that can help:

1. **cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_<capture_instance>**: This function returns all changes for a specified capture instance.
2. **cdc.fn_cdc_get_net_changes_<capture_instance>**: This function returns only the net changes (inserts and deletes) for a specified capture instance.
3. **cdc.fn_cdc_has_column_changed**: This function checks if a specific column has changed.

You can easily extract the change data and apply it to your target system using these functions. For example, you can use SSIS to read the change data using these functions and then transform and load it into your data warehouse.
