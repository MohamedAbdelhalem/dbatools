Alright, let's walk through the steps to set up Change Data Capture (CDC) and transactional replication together. This approach will help you capture data changes and replicate them efficiently.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Enable CDC on the Source Database:
First, enable CDC on your source database. Use the following SQL commands:
```sql
USE YourDatabaseName;
GO

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db;
GO
```

#### 2. Enable CDC on Specific Tables:
Enable CDC on the tables you want to track. For example, to enable CDC on a table named `YourTableName`:
```sql
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
    @source_schema = 'dbo',
    @source_name = 'YourTableName',
    @role_name = NULL;
GO
```

#### 3. Configure Transactional Replication:
Set up transactional replication to replicate the entire table, including the CDC change tables. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Configure the Distributor**:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Right-click the Replication folder and select "Configure Distribution...".
   - Follow the wizard to configure the distributor.

2. **Configure the Publisher**:
   - Right-click the Local Publications folder and select "New Publication...".
   - Follow the wizard to configure the publisher and select the database and tables you want to replicate (including CDC tables).

3. **Configure the Subscriber**:
   - Right-click the Local Subscriptions folder and select "New Subscription...".
   - Follow the wizard to configure the subscriber and define the subscription type (push or pull).

#### 4. Verify Configuration:
Ensure that CDC and replication are working correctly:
- **CDC**: Check the change tables to see if changes are being captured.
- **Replication**: Verify that changes are being replicated to the subscriber database.

#### 5. ETL Process:
Integrate the captured changes into your ETL process:
- Use SSIS or another ETL tool to read data from the CDC change tables in the source database.
- Transform the data as needed.
- Load the data into the destination (data warehouse).

When using Change Data Capture (CDC) with transactional replication in SQL Server, the ETL process using SSIS or another ETL tool typically reads from the **Subscriber**.

Here’s why:
- The **Publisher** is your primary, source database where the original transactions occur. It’s critical to minimize the load and impact on the Publisher to ensure optimal performance and availability.
- The **Subscriber** receives the replicated changes and maintains an up-to-date copy of the data. This makes it an ideal source for your ETL processes because it allows you to offload the data extraction and transformation workload from the primary database.

By reading from the Subscriber, you can ensure that your ETL processes don’t interfere with the performance of the primary database and that you can still capture all the necessary changes tracked by CDC.

### ETL Process with Subscriber
1. **Extract**: Use your ETL tool to read changes from the CDC tables on the Subscriber database.
2. **Transform**: Process the change data as needed for your data warehouse.
3. **Load**: Load the transformed data into the data warehouse.

This approach ensures that your ETL operations are efficient and have minimal impact on your primary operational systems.

### Important Considerations:
- **Latency**: There might be some latency between when changes are made and when they appear in the destination database.
- **Permissions**: Ensure that the required permissions are set for CDC and replication.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the health of your CDC and replication setup to ensure it is functioning correctly.
