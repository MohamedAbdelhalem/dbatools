Alright, let's walk through the steps to set up Change Data Capture (CDC) and transactional replication together. This approach will help you capture data changes and replicate them efficiently.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Enable CDC on the Source Database:
First, enable CDC on your source database. Use the following SQL commands:
```sql
USE YourDatabaseName;
GO

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db;
GO
```

#### 2. Enable CDC on Specific Tables:
Enable CDC on the tables you want to track. For example, to enable CDC on a table named `YourTableName`:
```sql
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
    @source_schema = 'dbo',
    @source_name = 'YourTableName',
    @role_name = NULL;
GO
```

#### 3. Configure Transactional Replication:
Set up transactional replication to replicate the entire table, including the CDC change tables. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Configure the Distributor**:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Right-click the Replication folder and select "Configure Distribution...".
   - Follow the wizard to configure the distributor.

2. **Configure the Publisher**:
   - Right-click the Local Publications folder and select "New Publication...".
   - Follow the wizard to configure the publisher and select the database and tables you want to replicate (including CDC tables).

3. **Configure the Subscriber**:
   - Right-click the Local Subscriptions folder and select "New Subscription...".
   - Follow the wizard to configure the subscriber and define the subscription type (push or pull).

#### 4. Verify Configuration:
Ensure that CDC and replication are working correctly:
- **CDC**: Check the change tables to see if changes are being captured.
- **Replication**: Verify that changes are being replicated to the subscriber database.

#### 5. ETL Process:
Integrate the captured changes into your ETL process:
- Use SSIS or another ETL tool to read data from the CDC change tables in the source database.
- Transform the data as needed.
- Load the data into the destination (data warehouse).

### Important Considerations:
- **Latency**: There might be some latency between when changes are made and when they appear in the destination database.
- **Permissions**: Ensure that the required permissions are set for CDC and replication.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the health of your CDC and replication setup to ensure it is functioning correctly.
